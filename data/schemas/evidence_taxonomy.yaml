# Evidence tier definitions
tiers:
  tier_1_approved:
    name: "Regulatory Approval"
    description: "Approved by major regulatory body (FDA, EMA, etc.) for at least one indication"
    criteria:
      - "Has received regulatory approval"
      - "Safety and efficacy established through rigorous review"
      - "Post-marketing surveillance data available"
    confidence_score: 1.0
    interpretation: |
      Highest quality evidence. The compound has passed regulatory review for specific 
      indications. Note: approval for one indication does NOT imply safety or efficacy 
      for other uses.
    examples:
      - "Semaglutide (Ozempic) - approved for type 2 diabetes"
      - "Tesamorelin (Egrifta) - approved for HIV lipodystrophy"
      
  tier_2_late_clinical:
    name: "Late-Stage Clinical Trials"
    description: "Phase II/III randomized controlled trial data available"
    criteria:
      - "Completed Phase II or Phase III RCT"
      - "Published in peer-reviewed journal"
      - "Adequate sample size and methodology"
    confidence_score: 0.85
    interpretation: |
      Strong human evidence but not yet approved. Results should be interpreted with 
      caution as regulatory approval requires additional scrutiny.
    examples:
      - "MK-677 - Phase II data for various indications"
      - "SS-31 (Elamipretide) - Phase II/III for mitochondrial diseases"
      
  tier_3_early_clinical:
    name: "Early Clinical Trials"
    description: "Phase I or early Phase II human data"
    criteria:
      - "Completed Phase I or early Phase II study"
      - "Safety data in humans available"
      - "Efficacy signals may be preliminary"
    confidence_score: 0.65
    interpretation: |
      Preliminary human data. Safety profile is being established. Efficacy claims 
      should be considered tentative.
    examples:
      - "Ipamorelin - early clinical studies"
      - "Thymosin beta-4 - early clinical trials"
      
  tier_4_preclinical:
    name: "Preclinical Only"
    description: "Animal studies or in vivo preclinical data only"
    criteria:
      - "Published preclinical studies"
      - "Animal model data available"
      - "No controlled human data"
    confidence_score: 0.45
    interpretation: |
      Limited evidence. Animal studies may not translate to humans. Safety and 
      efficacy in humans is UNKNOWN. Use in humans carries significant risk.
    examples:
      - "BPC-157 - extensive preclinical but limited human data"
      - "FOXO4-DRI - preclinical senolytic studies"
      
  tier_5_mechanistic:
    name: "Mechanistic Only"
    description: "In vitro studies or theoretical mechanism only"
    criteria:
      - "Cell culture or biochemical studies"
      - "Theoretical mechanism proposed"
      - "No in vivo validation"
    confidence_score: 0.25
    interpretation: |
      Very limited evidence. Biological plausibility without direct validation. 
      Translation to living organisms is highly uncertain.
    examples:
      - "Novel synthetic peptides with receptor binding data"
      - "Computationally designed peptides"
      
  tier_6_anecdotal:
    name: "Anecdotal"
    description: "Case reports, uncontrolled observations, user reports"
    criteria:
      - "Case reports or series"
      - "Uncontrolled observations"
      - "Community/user reports"
    confidence_score: 0.15
    interpretation: |
      Lowest quality evidence. Subject to significant bias, placebo effects, and 
      reporting errors. Should NOT be used to infer efficacy or safety.
    examples:
      - "Online user experience reports"
      - "Single case studies without controls"
      
  tier_unknown:
    name: "Unknown"
    description: "Insufficient data to classify"
    criteria:
      - "No published studies found"
      - "Conflicting or unreliable sources"
      - "Novel compound with minimal characterization"
    confidence_score: 0.05
    interpretation: |
      Evidence quality cannot be determined. Treat with extreme caution. 
      Unknown compounds may carry unpredictable risks.

# Confidence scoring
confidence_aggregation:
  description: "How to aggregate confidence across multiple sources"
  methods:

    weighted_average:
      description: "Weight by number of sources at each tier"
      use_when: "Multiple sources with varying quality"
    minimum:
      description: "Use lowest quality to be conservative"
      use_when: "Conflicting evidence exists"
