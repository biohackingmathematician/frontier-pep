# Ethics & Responsible Use

## CRITICAL DISCLAIMER

**This Peptide Atlas is for RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.**

- It does **NOT** constitute medical advice, treatment guidance, or clinical recommendations.
- The inclusion of any peptide does **NOT** imply it is safe, effective, legal, or appropriate for any individual.
- Many peptides mapped here are **experimental, off-label, inadequately studied, or not approved** for human use. They may carry **serious, unknown, or life-threatening risks**.
- We provide **NO dosing information, NO protocol design, NO usage recommendations**.
- Any decision to use such compounds must be made **with a qualified healthcare professional** and must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

**If you are considering using any peptide, consult a licensed physician. Do not self-prescribe. Do not self-inject.**

## Purpose of This Document

This document outlines the ethical framework guiding the development and intended use of The Frontier Peptide Atlas. We recognize that computational tools analyzing bioactive compounds carry inherent risks of misuse, and we have designed this project with explicit safeguards.

---

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. No Therapeutic Guidance

This project explicitly **does not provide**:

- Dosing information or recommendations
- Administration protocols or schedules
- Cycle designs or "stacking" suggestions
- Timing or frequency guidance
- Any information that could be construed as treatment advice

**Why:** Providing such information without proper clinical context, individual patient assessment, and medical supervision could lead to serious harm.

### 2. Evidence-Based Transparency

Every peptide and relationship in this atlas includes explicit evidence tier classification:

| Tier | Description | User Should Understand |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| Tier 1 | Regulatory approval | Has met rigorous safety/efficacy standards for specific indication |
| Tier 2 | Late-stage clinical trials | Strong human evidence but not yet approved |
| Tier 3 | Early clinical trials | Preliminary human data with significant uncertainty |
| Tier 4 | Preclinical only | Animal/cell data only; human translation unknown |
| Tier 5 | Mechanistic only | Theoretical; no direct biological validation |
| Tier 6 | Anecdotal | Case reports, uncontrolled observations |
| Unknown | Insufficient data | Extreme caution warranted |

**Why:** Users must understand the quality of evidence underlying any claim. Many peptides in this atlas have limited or no human data.

### 3. Risk Transparency

All peptides include associated risks, categorized by:

- **Severity**: Mild → Potentially Fatal
- **Reversibility**: Reversible → Irreversible
- **Evidence quality**: Same tier system as effects

**Why:** Benefits cannot be evaluated without understanding risks. Many risks are understudied or unknown.

### 4. No Endorsement

Inclusion in this atlas does **not** imply:

- That a peptide is safe
- That a peptide is effective
- That a peptide should be used
- That benefits outweigh risks
- That the peptide is legal in any jurisdiction

**Why:** This is a descriptive mapping tool, not a recommendation engine.

## Intended Use Cases

### Appropriate Uses

- **Academic Research**: Understanding mechanistic relationships between peptide classes  
- **Literature Review**: Identifying research gaps and areas needing further study  
- **Educational**: Teaching graph-based approaches to biomedical knowledge representation  
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Identifying potential mechanistic connections for future research  
- **Methodology Development**: Demonstrating GNN/TDA applications in bioinformatics  

### Inappropriate Uses

- **Self-medication**: Do not use this tool to make personal treatment decisions  
- **Clinical guidance**: This is not a clinical decision support system  
- **Drug recommendation**: This tool does not recommend specific compounds  
- **Sourcing information**: We provide no information about obtaining any compound  
- **Protocol design**: We do not provide usage protocols

## Known Limitations

### Data Limitations

1. **Incomplete coverage**: Not all peptides or relationships are included
2. **Evolving evidence**: The scientific literature changes; this atlas may not reflect the latest findings
3. **Source quality variation**: Some relationships are based on stronger evidence than others
4. **Selection bias**: Focus on certain peptide classes may introduce perspective bias

### Methodological Limitations

1. **Model uncertainty**: GNN embeddings reflect training data patterns, not ground truth
2. **Topological interpretation**: Mapper clusters require expert interpretation
3. **No causal claims**: Associations do not imply causation
4. **Computational artifacts**: Some patterns may reflect methodology rather than biology

### Scope Limitations

1. **No pharmacokinetics**: We do not model absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion
2. **No drug interactions**: Compound interactions are not modeled
3. **No individual variation**: Genetic and phenotypic variation is not captured
4. **No contraindications**: Medical contraindications are not systematically included

## Regulatory Considerations

### Legal Status of Peptides

Many peptides in this atlas have complex regulatory status:

- Some are approved for specific medical conditions
- Some are under clinical investigation
- Some are classified as "research chemicals" with no human use authorization
- Some may be controlled substances in certain jurisdictions
- Legal status varies by country and may change over time

**Users are responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable laws in their jurisdiction.**

### Off-Label Use

Even approved peptides may be discussed here in contexts beyond their approved indications. Off-label use:

- Carries additional risks due to limited evidence
- May not be covered by medical insurance
- Should only be considered under medical supervision
- May have legal implications depending on jurisdiction

## For Healthcare Professionals

If you are a healthcare professional considering this atlas as a reference:

1. **This is not a prescribing guide** — Use primary literature and approved resources
2. **Verify all information** — Cross-reference with peer-reviewed sources
3. **Evidence tiers matter** — Pay close attention to evidence quality classifications
4. **Patient safety first** — Many compounds here lack adequate human safety data
5. **Stay within your scope** — Consult specialists for unfamiliar compound classes

---

## For Researchers

If you are a researcher using this atlas:

1. **Cite appropriately** — Acknowledge the limitations in your publications
2. **Validate findings** — Use this as a starting point, not a definitive source
3. **Report errors** — Help improve the atlas by reporting inaccuracies
4. **Extend responsibly** — If you extend this work, maintain ethical safeguards
5. **Publish responsibly** — Consider potential misuse of your findings

---

## For the General Public

If you are not a healthcare professional or researcher:

1. **Do not self-treat** — This tool is not designed for personal medical decisions
2. **Consult professionals** — Any interest in peptides should be discussed with a physician
3. **Understand limitations** — Many compounds here are experimental and risky
4. **Be skeptical** — Online information about peptides is often misleading or false
5. **Prioritize safety** — Your health is more important than any potential benefit
